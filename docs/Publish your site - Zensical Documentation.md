# Publish your site - Zensical Documentation

[Zensical Documentation](https://zensical.org) > Get started > Publish your site

The great thing about hosting project documentation in a `git` repository is the ability to deploy it automatically when new changes are pushed. Zensical makes this ridiculously simple.

## GitHub Pages

If you're already hosting your code on GitHub, [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) is certainly the most convenient way to publish your project documentation. It's free of charge and pretty easy to set up.

### with GitHub Actions

Using [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) you can automate the deployment of your project documentation on pushes to a specific branch in your repository.

> **Prerequisite:** GitHub Pages for your repository must be configured [to publish using GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-your-github-pages-site#publishing-with-a-custom-github-actions-workflow).

If you created your site with `zensical new`, a publishing workflow was already created for your project in `.github/workflows/docs.yml`. If you don't already have this workflow, create a new GitHub Actions workflow at the root of your repository (e.g. `.github/workflows/docs.yml`) with the following contents:

```yaml
name: Documentation
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - master
      - main
permissions:
  contents: read
  pages: write
  id-token: write
jobs:
  deploy:
    environment:
      name: github-pages
      url: ${{ steps.deployment.outputs.page_url }}
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/configure-pages@v6
      - uses: actions/checkout@v7
      - uses: actions/setup-python@v6
        with:
          python-version: 3.x
      - run: pip install zensical
      - run: zensical build --clean # (1)!
      - uses: actions/upload-pages-artifact@v5
        with:
          path: site
      - uses: actions/deploy-pages@v5
        id: deployment
```

> (1) At the moment, we do not recommend using caches on CI systems as the caching functionality will undergo revisions as we optimize the performance of Zensical.

When a new commit is pushed to the branch you are using for deployment (e.g. `master` or `main`), the static site is automatically built and deployed. Push your changes to see the workflow in action.

Your documentation should shortly appear at `<username>.github.io/<repository>`.

## GitLab Pages

If you're hosting your code on GitLab, deploying to [GitLab Pages](https://gitlab.com/pages) can be done by using the [GitLab CI](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/) task runner. At the root of your repository, create a task definition named `.gitlab-ci.yml` and copy and paste the following contents:

```yaml
pages:
  stage: deploy
  image: python:latest
  script:
    - pip install zensical
    - zensical build --clean # (1)!
  pages:
    publish: site # (2)!
  rules:
    - if: '$CI_COMMIT_BRANCH == $CI_DEFAULT_BRANCH'
```

> (2) The Gitlab documentation says that the SSG should adapt to Gitlab Pages, which uses the folder `public` by default but it is possible to [configure the default folder](https://docs.gitlab.com/user/project/pages/introduction/#customize-the-default-folder) as shown here.

When a new commit is pushed to the [default branch](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/repository/branches/default.html) (e.g. `master` or `main`), the static site is automatically built and deployed. Push your changes to see the workflow in action.

> **Gitlab Pages settings:** By default, Gitlab Pages publishes to a domain that includes a random string. Untick the `Use unique domain` box in your Gitlab Pages settings for your production deployment. Also make sure to set the visibility for Pages under `Settings > General > Visibility` if you want a public site.

Your documentation will be published under `<username>.gitlab.io/<repository>`.
